# Wheat Classifier: Predict Wheat Type
The Seed Classification ML Model aims to classify different types of wheat seeds into three categories: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. The model uses various features related to the geometric properties of the seeds to accurately distinguish between these types.

## Understanding the Dataset
- **Area**: The area of the seed.
- **Perimeter**: The perimeter of the seed.
- **Compactness**: Calculated as square of perimeter divided by area.
- **Length of Kernel**:  The length of the kernel.
- **Width of Kernel**: The width of the kernel.
- **Asymmetry Coefficient**: A measure of the asymmetry of the seed.
- **Length of Kernel Groove**: The length of the kernel groove.

These features provide a comprehensive set of attributes that help in differentiating between the three types of wheat seeds. The model uses these features to learn patterns and make predictions about the seed type based on new input data.

## Applications
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning algorithms can be applied to classify wheat seed type based on its input features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Techniques such as data visualization and correlation analysis help uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
- **Challenges and Considerations**: Addressing missing values, handling imbalanced datasets, selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, and ensuring model interpretability are crucial considerations.
